## Description
The game challenges players to guess words before they run out of lives.  
It includes two modes:
- Singleplayer → Choose from themed categories like *Movies, Marvel Characters, TV Shows, Video Games, and Athletes*.  
- Multiplayer → One player enters a secret word for the other to guess.  

Visuals such as the background and title screen are displayed using `turtle` and custom images.
